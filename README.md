# 01-maze-audiocode-smeerws

### Project description: 
This project serves as sample project for spatial audio. 
Explore sound in its basics in virtual reality (VR).

Overgrown stylised labyrinth (with ivy) with blossoming trees and flowers
in the sunset mood (golden hour).

The aim of the game: to collect the scattered items for a picnic and to cut his way through the ivy walls with a pair of garden shears.

Once all the items are on the picnic blanket, a golden key appears in front of the ivy wall. After that, he can use the key to open the door and escape from the maze.

### Development platform: 
OS: macOS Big Sur, Game Engine: Unity 2019.1.14f1, Visual Studio for Mac 8.9.7, Steam,  
SteamVR 2.5.0 (https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steamvr_unity_plugin/releases/tag/2.5.0)

Note on Unity Version 2019.1.14f1 and SteamVR: The SteamVr plugin has many issues when used with Unity Versions > 2019.1.3 because the XR Management System changed from 2019.1.3 to 2019.1.4. Valve is working on it, so we will use these older versions for the VR programming.  
Download steamvr_2_5_08_19.unitypackage, import the package: Assets --> Import Package --> Custome Package

## Software/Hardware Requirements:
